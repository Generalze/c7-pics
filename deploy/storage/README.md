# Private object storage

One private bucket holds two kinds of personal data:

- **Incident and election evidence** — photographs and documents that may later
  support a legal process, so their integrity has to be defensible.
- **Voter-registration documents** — PVC images and registration slips. These
  are identity documents belonging to real people.

Neither is ever public. The application reads them only through short-lived
signed URLs, and every grant and refusal is written to the audit log.

## Required bucket configuration

Provision this before the first deploy. Nothing in the compose topology creates
a bucket, and the API refuses to start in production with any storage driver
other than `s3`.

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Public access | Blocked, all four settings | A public object here is a member's identity document on the open internet. |
| Versioning | Enabled | An overwritten original is otherwise unrecoverable, and the hash recorded at upload would no longer match anything. |
| Object Lock | Enabled in governance mode, where the provider supports it | Evidence that can be silently replaced is evidence that cannot be relied on. |
| Encryption at rest | Enabled (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) | |
| TLS | Required | `DenyUnencryptedTransport` in the policy enforces it; the endpoint must also be `https://`. |
| Lifecycle expiry | **None on committed objects.** One rule, on `voter-verification/pending/` only | Evidence has no expiry date, and a lifecycle rule that quietly deletes it destroys the record without an audit trail. The pending namespace is the sole exception, and it holds only bytes no database row owns yet. |

## Applying the policy

`bucket-policy.json` is a template. Substitute the three placeholders:

- `BUCKET_NAME` — the bucket, e.g. `ogun-staging-private`
- `APPLICATION_PRINCIPAL_ARN` — the identity the API and worker use
- `EVIDENCE_CUSTODIAN_PRINCIPAL_ARN` — a separate, rarely used identity that may
  delete a committed object. It must not be the application principal, so an
  application credential leak cannot destroy evidence.

## Two custody states

A document has to be written to storage before the database row that owns it
exists, because a row must never name an object that is not there. That leaves a
window in which bytes exist with no owner, and a transaction that fails inside
that window would strand an identity document with no record and no lifecycle.

So the bucket holds two kinds of object, and the policy treats them differently:

| Namespace | State | Application may delete? |
|---|---|---|
| `voter-verification/pending/*` | Uncommitted. No database row owns these yet. | **Yes**, and only here. |
| `voter-verification/<year>/<month>/*` | Committed. A row names it. | No. |
| `evidence/*` | Committed evidence. | No. |

The application is granted `DeleteObject` on the pending prefix and explicitly
denied it everywhere else, by `NotResource`. The narrowness is what makes this
safe: the alternative — letting the application delete anywhere so it can tidy
up after itself — would put permanent election evidence within reach of any bug
or leaked credential in the request path.

The same boundary is enforced in code. `discardPendingObject` refuses any key
outside the pending namespace, and `promotePendingObject` refuses to move a
document *into* it. A misconfigured policy is therefore not the only thing
standing between a cleanup and evidence destruction.

### Pending lifecycle rule

A pending object is normally removed within the same request, either by
promotion or by cleanup. A lifecycle rule is the backstop for the case where the
process dies between the two.

**Important:** On a versioned bucket, `Expiration` alone creates a delete marker
but leaves noncurrent versions behind. A complete pending-object lifecycle
requires three layers: current-version expiration, noncurrent-version cleanup,
and expired-delete-marker removal.

```json
{
  "Rules": [
    {
      "ID": "expire-uncommitted-registration-objects",
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Filter": { "Prefix": "voter-verification/pending/" },
      "Expiration": { "Days": 1 },
      "NoncurrentVersionExpiration": { "NoncurrentDays": 1 }
    },
    {
      "ID": "remove-expired-pending-delete-markers",
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Filter": { "Prefix": "voter-verification/pending/" },
      "Expiration": { "ExpiredObjectDeleteMarker": true }
    }
  ]
}
```

It must carry that prefix. A lifecycle rule without a filter, or with a broader
one, would put an expiry date on permanent election evidence — which is the
thing this bucket exists to prevent.

**How it works:**
- `Expiration: { Days: 1 }`: Removes the current version after 1 day of inactivity, creating a delete marker.
- `NoncurrentVersionExpiration: { NoncurrentDays: 1 }`: Removes all noncurrent versions after 1 day, ensuring no version remains archived.
- `Expiration: { ExpiredObjectDeleteMarker: true }`: Removes the delete marker once all versions are gone (reduces metadata clutter).
- Application cleanup is expected to delete the exact version immediately via `versionId` query parameter.
- The lifecycle rule is only a backstop for process crashes; it is not the primary deletion mechanism.

**Version-aware deletion:**

The application retrieves the current version ID via a HEAD request (`x-amz-version-id` header)
and includes it in the DELETE request to remove the exact version rather than creating a delete marker.
On versioned buckets, this ensures deleted pending objects are not left behind as noncurrent versions.

**Important distinction:**
- A delete marker is metadata that indicates an object was deleted, not the bytes themselves.
- `Expiration: { ExpiredObjectDeleteMarker: true }` removes the marker, freeing storage.
- This rule only applies after all underlying versions have already been removed by `NoncurrentVersionExpiration`.

```bash
sed -e "s|BUCKET_NAME|$STORAGE_BUCKET|g" \
    -e "s|APPLICATION_PRINCIPAL_ARN|$APP_PRINCIPAL|g" \
    -e "s|EVIDENCE_CUSTODIAN_PRINCIPAL_ARN|$CUSTODIAN_PRINCIPAL|g" \
    deploy/storage/bucket-policy.json > /tmp/bucket-policy.json

aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket "$STORAGE_BUCKET" --policy file:///tmp/bucket-policy.json
```

On MinIO and other S3-compatible providers the policy grammar differs. The
requirements that must hold regardless of syntax are: no anonymous read, TLS
required, and delete separated from the application identity.

## Object Lock Configuration

**Important:** Do NOT enable a default bucket-wide retention policy.

Object Lock in governance mode provides evidence immutability for committed
objects, but a global retention policy would make pending objects undeletable.
Pending objects must remain deletable to support transaction rollback.

If Object Lock is enabled:
1. Enable governance mode (not compliance mode)
2. Do NOT set a default retention policy on all objects
3. Do NOT enable automatic retention on object uploads
4. Committed-object retention may be configured later with an explicit design
   that does not affect the pending namespace

Currently, immutability is enforced by:
- Application code boundary (only `discardPendingObject` can delete)
- IAM/bucket policy boundary (DELETE operations scoped to pending namespace)
- Versioning (allowing historical recovery if an object is overwritten)
- Separate custodian authority (delete operations outside pending namespace)

## Verifying it

After applying, confirm an object is genuinely unreachable without a signature:

```bash
# Expect 403. A 200 here means identity documents are publicly readable.
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' \
  "$STORAGE_ENDPOINT/$STORAGE_BUCKET/voter-verification/probe.txt"
```

Staging and production must use different buckets. A staging instance pointed at
the production bucket lets a UAT tester open a real member's identity document.
