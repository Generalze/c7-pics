/**
 * One authority takes custody of a voter-registration document.
 *
 * These are identity documents — a PVC image, a registration slip — and feature
 * 029 requires them to be stored privately, reachable only through
 * authentication, authorization and controlled short-lived access, with
 * permanent public URLs prohibited.
 *
 * They were not stored at all. `VoterVerificationDocument` recorded a storage
 * key the client chose, a size the client stated and a SHA-256 the client
 * computed, with `storageProvider` set to the literal string
 * "PRIVATE_OBJECT_STORAGE_STUB". Three routes wrote that record, each with its
 * own copy of the logic, and the access route answered with
 * `crypto.randomUUID()` as though it were an access grant.
 *
 * Storing the bytes created a second problem, which this also guards. They must
 * be written before the row exists — a row must never name an object that is
 * not there — so a transaction that then fails would strand an identity
 * document with no database owner and no lifecycle. Documents therefore land in
 * a pending namespace and are promoted only once the row is committed, and the
 * only deletion the application can perform is bounded to that namespace.
 *
 * This guards the shape of the fix: every write goes through one authority,
 * custody is attached to the transaction outcome, and committed evidence stays
 * undeletable by application credentials.
